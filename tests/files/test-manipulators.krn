!! This file can be used to test spine manipulator processing.
!! The 6 spine manipulators:
!!   *^  == split a spine into two subspines
!!   *v  == merge subspines into a spine.  subspines may original
!!          from different tracks, although this should generally be avoided.
!!          The data-type for such a spine will be the data-type of the
!!          first (left-most) field being merged.
!!  *x   == switch the order of two fields on a line.  If a spine contains
!!          an *x, then the next field must also have a *x.
!!  *-   == terminate a spine.
!!  **   == initiate a spine (with the data type appended, such as **kern).
!!  *+   == add a new spine after the data has started.  Similar to *^,
!!          but the right-most field on the next line is a new spine/track.
